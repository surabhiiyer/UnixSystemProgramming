Assume that you are automating Student Information System (SIS) to store
information about students at “XYZ” college. The admission section has asked to
include following details of the student: name, usn, rollno, semester, branch, email
id, address, parent name, parent mobile number, student mobile number, cet /
comdek rank, PU / 10+2 percentage, sgpa and cgpa. Typically, the strength of
each branch varies from 140 to 160 for II, III and IV year and is known during
data entry only. However, the strength of I year varies from 118 to 124. Write a C
program to simulate the process of accepting student information and storing
them in file named after the branch, semester and batch (Admission Year). Let us
assume that the project is complete and student information is also fed to the
system before the commencement of the classes.
After 05 days from the class commencement, the admission section comes up with
a new requirement that the intake of ISE and CSE branches for I year (I semester)
have been increased by the university from 120 to 150. Let us say, the 30 and 28
students will choose ISE and CSE respectively during casual vacancy round. How
do you handle this scenario programmatically and also make sure to college
authorities that the new student’s entries are updated.
